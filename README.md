# hentapi
A Powershell-based imageboard search/download tool.

# Documentation
 - The program is currently undergoing a very large rework, so this readme will be left incomplete for now.
 - hentapi has most of its documentation built in. To view it, run the command `Get-Help .\hentapi.ps1` in the same directory as the program itself.

# Other Info
 - If you have any issues with the program or suggestions for its improvement, please open an issue and let me know.
 - The program has an optional functionality that adds metadata tags to your downloaded images. To use this on images, you'll need to put [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) in your PATH. To use this on video files, you'll need to put [FFMpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [mp4v2](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=171038) in your PATH.
